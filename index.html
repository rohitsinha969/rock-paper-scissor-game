        Objective

        Choose Your Move: At the beginning of each round, you'll have the opportunity to choose your move by clicking on
        the respective buttons for Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

        Computer's Move: After you've made your choice, the computer will randomly select its move. Don't worry; the
        computer doesn't cheat!

        Determine the Winner: The winner is determined based on the following rules:

        Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins)
        Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins)
        Paper covers Rock (Paper wins)
        If both you and the computer choose the same move, the round ends in a tie.
        View the Result: Once the computer's move is revealed, you'll see the outcome of the round displayed on the
        screen. It will tell you whether you won, lost, or if it's a tie.

        Psychology: Sometimes, predicting your opponent's move based on psychology can be effective. If you notice a
        pattern in the computer's choices, you might be able to anticipate its next move.
